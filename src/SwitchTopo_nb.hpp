/**
 * @brief Switch between to different topologies using non-blocking communications
 * 
 * Reorganize the memory between 2 different topologies, also accounting for a
 * "principal axis" which is aligned with the fast rotating index.
 * 
 * Communications are handled by packing data in blocks (i.e. chuncks). These 
 * smaller pieces are sent and recieved asynchronesouly, in a hope for reducing
 * the time required for communication.
 * 
 * The a memory shift can be specified in the switch between the topologies, when
 * there is a need for skipping some data at the left or right side of a given direction.
