 * From [1], the definition of Ji0 is
 *    \f[
 *      Ji0(x) = - \int_x^\infty t^{-1} J_0(t) dt
 *    \f]
 * We here use an alternative representation from [1,eq.3]:
 *    \f[
 *      Ji0(x) = \gamma + \log(x/2) - \int_0^x  \frac{(1-J0(u))}{u}  du
 *    \f]
 * and we define the last integral term as "Ji0c". At the bottom of 
 * the same page in [1], Ji0c is expressed as an infinite sum of 
 * polynomials. This is the formulation that we use here.
 * The sum is truncated at n=50, and the result is thus only valid
 * for (0 <= x <= ~30). 
 * 
 * A more general evaluation of Ji0 can be performed using Meijer-G functions.
